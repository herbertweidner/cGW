ZP22 readme

The task of the program ZP22.m is to detect the gravitational wave of the binary star 'Zeta Phoenicis'. This wave is expected at fGW0 = 13.8630 µHz. The data set can be generated by barometers, gravimeters, or any other sensor. Data points are expected, measured at intervals of 3600 seconds over a period of at least one year.

The program ZP22.m determines the frequency drift and some phase modulations of the signal.

Line 8: Starting value for the frequency search in the year 2000

Line 21: Preprocessor terminated, search frequency fGW = 1.4e-6 Hz

Lines 26 and 28: Selection of bandwidths

Lines 30-34: Starting values ​​for the iterations; Five different modulations

Special feature regarding 'directed search': When pxJ=3.7 is selected, the phase angle is *not* iterated to avoid deviating from the target zeta phonicis. If the SNR is sufficiently good after approximately 100 iterations, the program can be briefly paused, pxJ=3.71 entered, and iteration resumed. pxJ will then also be optimized. Background: Apparently, there are multiple signals at a frequency of approximately 13.8630 µHz, and the program might focus on a different source with a different direction.

Line 70: Set the maximum number of iterations

Line 73: Sum of all phase modulations. plot(z2)

Lines 78-82: Each modulation is treated equally.

Line 91: Save the successive results of the iterations.

After all iterations are complete:

Display the columns of the array 'R' and correct the initial values ​​in lines 30-34.

Then: Copy the following lines into the 'command window':

Lines 96-100: Compare the spectrum with the mirror spectrum; are there any other modulations?

Lines 96-103: Display the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

Restart the iterations?
